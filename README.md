# amplifier_v4
This is a 4th version of a project done in STM32CubeIDE.
MCU is STM32L071VBT, 100 pin version.

Project includes everything that is needed to control the integrated amplifier:
- input switching
- volume adjustment
- tone adjustement
- tone bypass
- speakers on/off
- loudness or bass boost on/off
- protections (DC on outputs and voltage imbalance)
- temperature monitoring and protection from overheating
- ir remote control functionality
- Bluetooth Low Energy (nRF52) communication over UART

Project is in alpha stage and is fully functional.

There are some things missing and some bugs which are being adressed but otherwise should be crash free.
